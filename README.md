## Game description

Meisterkopf is a 1 vs 1 online browser game. A player is either a codemaker or a codebreaker. At the start of the game, the codemaker will create a secret code of four colors. The codebreaker gets 8 guesses to guess the secret code. The players will switch roles when the round ends. After two rounds, the player with the highest score wins the game.
